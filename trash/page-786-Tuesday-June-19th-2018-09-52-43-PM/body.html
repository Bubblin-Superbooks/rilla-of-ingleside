None of them came back just as they went away, not even those who had been so fortunate as to escape injury.</p><p>One spring day, when the daffodils were blowing on the Ingleside lawn, and the banks of the brook in Rainbow Valley were sweet with white and purple violets, the little, lazy afternoon accommodation train pulled into the Glen station.
