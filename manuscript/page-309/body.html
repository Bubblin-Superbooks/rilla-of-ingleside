<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Rilla was standing among the budding daffodils with tear-filled eyes. Her evening was spoiled; she detested Susan, who had somehow hurt Walter; and Jem--had Jem been gassed? Had he died in torture?</p><p>"I can't endure this suspense any longer," said Rilla desperately.</p><p>But she endured it as the others did for another week. Then a letter came from Jem. He was all right.</p><p>"I've come through without a scratch, dad. Don't know how I or any of us did it. You'll have seen all about it in the papers--I can't write of it. But the Huns haven't got through--they won't get through. Jerry was knocked stiff by a shell one time, but it was only the shock. He was all right in a few days. Grant is safe, too."</p></div> </div>
