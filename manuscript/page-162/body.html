Well, I'm off home in a few days myself."</p><p>A queer little wind of desolation that even Jem's going had not caused blew over Rilla's spirit.</p><p>"Why? You have another month of vacation."</p><p>"Yes--but I can't hang around Four Winds and enjoy myself when the world's on fire like this. It's me for little old Toronto where I'll find some way of helping in spite of this bally ankle. I'm not looking at Jem and Jerry--makes me too sick with envy. You girls are great--no crying, no grim endurance. The boys'll go off with a good taste in their mouths. I hope Persis and mother will be as game when my turn comes."</p></div> </div>
