<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Susan, in her pursuit of Wilson and politics, presently came upon something that disturbed her and exclaimed in a tone of bitter disappointment,</p><p>"That devilish Kaiser has only a boil after all."</p><p>"Don't swear, Susan," said Dr. Blythe, pulling a long face.</p><p>"'Devilish' is not swearing, doctor, dear. I have always understood that swearing was taking the name of the Almighty in vain?"</p><p>"Well, it isn't--ahem--refined," said the doctor, winking at Miss Oliver.</p><p>"No, doctor, dear, the devil and the Kaiser--if so be that they are really two different people--are not refined. And you cannot refer to them in a refined way. So I abide by what I said, although you may notice that I am careful not to use such expressions when young Rilla is about. And I maintain that the papers have no right to say that the Kaiser has pneumonia and raise people's hopes, and then come out and say he has nothing but a boil. A boil, indeed! I wish he was covered with them."</p></div> </div>
