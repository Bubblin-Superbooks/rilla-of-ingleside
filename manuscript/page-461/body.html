Before you come home tonight get a marriage license--a marriage license--yes, a marriage license--and a wedding-ring. Did you get that? And will you do it? Very well, be sure you do it--it is your only chance."</p><p>Flushed with triumph--for her only fear was that she might not be able to locate Joe in time--Rilla rang the Pryor ring.

Well, Mr. Pryor, will you kindly ask Miranda if she can come up this afternoon and help me with some sewing. It is very important, or I would not trouble her. Oh--thank you."</p></div> </div>
