Well, here we are at the House of Dreams. It seems lonely this summer. The Fords didn't come?"</p><p>"Mr. and Mrs. Ford and Persis didn't. Kenneth did--but he stayed with his mother's people over-harbour. We haven't seen a great deal of him this summer. He's a little lame, so didn't go about very much."</p><p>"Lame?
