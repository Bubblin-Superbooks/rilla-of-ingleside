<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>There had been a trench raid on the Canadian front--a little trench raid so insignificant that it was never even mentioned in the dispatches and when it was over Lieutenant James Blythe was reported "wounded and missing."</p><p>"I think this is even worse than the news of his death would have been," moaned Rilla through her white lips, that night.</p><p>"No--no--'missing' leaves a little hope, Rilla," urged Gertrude Oliver.</p><p>"Yes--torturing, agonized hope that keeps you from ever becoming quite resigned to the worst," said Rilla. "Oh, Miss Oliver--must we go for weeks and months--not knowing whether Jem is alive or dead? Perhaps we will never know. I--I cannot bear it--I cannot. Walter--and now Jem. This will kill mother--look at her face, Miss Oliver, and you will see that. And Faith--poor Faith--how can she bear it?"</p></div> </div>
