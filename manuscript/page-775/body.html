<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> We've rented a little farm just out of the village, and we're going to settle down there. Jim wanted to stay in England but I says 'No.' I hankered to try a new country and I've always thought Canada would suit me."</p><p>"I'm so glad you are going to live near us. You'll let Jims come here often, won't you? I love him dearly."</p><p>"No doubt you do, miss, for a lovabler child I never did see. We understand, Jim and me, what you've done for him, and you won't find us ungrateful. He can come here whenever you want him and I'll always be glad of any advice from you about his bringing up. He is more your baby than anyone else's I should say, and I'll see that you get your fair share of him, miss."</p></div> </div>
