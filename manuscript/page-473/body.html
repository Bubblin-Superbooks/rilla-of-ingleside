<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Una Meredith and Rilla and Susan washed the dishes, tidied up, left a cold supper and Miranda's pitiful little note on the table for Mr. Pryor, and walked home, while the mystic veil of dreamy, haunted winter twilight wrapped itself over the Glen.</p><p>"I would really not have minded being a war-bride myself," remarked Susan sentimentally.</p><p>But Rilla felt rather flat--perhaps as a reaction to all the excitement and rush of the past thirty-six hours. She was disappointed somehow--the whole affair had been so ludicrous, and Miranda and Joe so lachrymose and commonplace.</p><p>"If Miranda hadn't given that wretched dog such an enormous dinner he wouldn't have had that fit," she said crossly. "I warned her--but she said she couldn't starve the poor dog--he would soon be all she had left, etc. I could have shaken her."</p></div> </div>
