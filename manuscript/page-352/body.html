The eyes of youth did not see how she was to go on living.</p><p>When they turned in at the Ingleside gate Walter stopped in the shadows of the old pines and drew Rilla close to him.</p><p>"Rilla-my-Rilla, there were girls as sweet and pure as you in Belgium and Flanders. You--even you--know what their fate was. We must make it impossible for such things to happen again while the world lasts. You'll help me, won't you?"</p><p>"I'll try, Walter," she said. "Oh, I will try."</p><p>As she clung to him with her face pressed against his shoulder she knew that it had to be. She accepted the fact then and there. He must go--her beautiful Walter with his beautiful soul and dreams and ideals. And she had known all along that it would come sooner or later.</p></div> </div>
