She knew that Rilla longed to be "out"--to go to parties as Nan and Di did, and to have dainty evening dresses and--yes, there is no mincing matters--beaux! In the plural, at that! As for Walter, Miss Oliver knew that he had written a sequence of sonnets "to Rosamond"--i.e., Faith Meredith--and that he aimed at a Professorship of English literature in some big college. She knew his passionate love of beauty and his equally passionate hatred of ugliness; she knew his strength and his weakness.</p><p>Walter was, as ever, the handsomest of the Ingleside boys. Miss Oliver found pleasure in looking at him for his good looks--he was so exactly like what she would have liked her own son to be. Glossy black hair, brilliant dark grey eyes, faultless features.</p></div> </div>
