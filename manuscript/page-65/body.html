Everything about her seemed long and thin and pale. She looked mournfully upon Rilla Blythe and said sadly,</p><p>"Is your hair all your own?"</p><p>"Of course it is," cried Rilla indignantly.</p><p>"Ah, well!" Cousin Sophia sighed. "It might be better for you if it wasn't! Such a lot of hair takes from a person's strength. It's a sign of consumption, I've heard, but I hope it won't turn out like that in your case. I s'pose you'll all be dancing tonight--even the minister's boys most likely. I s'pose his girls won't go that far. Ah, well, I never held with dancing.</p></div> </div>
