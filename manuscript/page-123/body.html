<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>The doctor and his wife went out of the room. Jem had gone--Walter had gone--Shirley got up to go. Rilla and Susan remained staring at each other across the deserted table. Rilla had not yet cried--she was too stunned for tears. Then she saw that Susan was crying--Susan, whom she had never seen shed a tear before.</p><p>"Oh, Susan, will he really go?" she asked.</p><p>"It--it--it is just ridiculous, that is what it is," said Susan.</p><p>She wiped away her tears, gulped resolutely and got up.</p><p>"I am going to wash the dishes. That has to be done, even if everybody has gone crazy. There now, dearie, do not you cry. Jem will go, most likely--but the war will be over long before he gets anywhere near it. Let us take a brace and not worry your poor mother."</p></div> </div>
