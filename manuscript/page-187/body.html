<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Oh, for mother--or Susan! Her eyes fell on an enormous blue soup tureen at the back of the dresser.</p><p>"May I have this to--to lay him in?" she asked.</p><p>"Well, 'tain't mine but I guess yez kin take it. Don't smash it if yez can help--Jim might make a fuss about it if he comes back alive--which he sure will, seein' he ain't any good. He brung that old tureen out from England with him--said it'd always been in the family. Him and Min never used it--never had enough soup to put in it--but Jim thought the world of it. He was mighty perticuler about some things but didn't worry him none that there weren't much in the way o' eatables to put in the dishes."</p></div> </div>
