How any one could ever dance aga' after a judgment like that I cannot comprehend."</p><p>"Did she ever dance again?" asked Rilla pertly.</p><p>"I told you she dropped dead. Of course she never danced again, poor creature. She was a Kirke from Lowbridge. You ain't a-going off like that with nothing on your bare neck, are you?"</p><p>"It's a hot evening," protested Rilla. "But I'll put on a scarf when we go on the water."</p><p>"I knew of a boat load of young folks who went sailing on that harbour forty years ago just such a night as this--just exactly such a night as this," said Cousin Sophia lugubriously, "and they were upset and drowned--every last one of them. I hope nothing like that'll happen to you tonight. Do you ever try anything for the freckles? I used to find plantain juice real good."</p></div> </div>
