But do not tell me that it will be the final farewell. He will be back on leave before he goes overseas, will he not?"</p><p>"We hope so but we are not very sure. I am making up my mind that he will not, so that there will be no disappointment to bear. Susan, I am determined that I will send my boy off tomorrow with a smile. He shall not carry away with him the remembrance of a weak mother who had not the courage to send when he had the courage to go. I hope none of us will cry."</p></div> </div>
