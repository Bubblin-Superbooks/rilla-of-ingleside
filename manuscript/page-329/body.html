It would have been very awkward for us both, don't you think?"</p><p>Now for the humble pie.</p><p>"I want to apologize to you for saying that, Irene." said Rilla steadily. "I should not have said it and I have been very sorry ever since. Will you forgive me?"</p><p>"And sing at your concert?" said Irene sweetly and insultingly.</p><p>"If you mean," said Rilla miserably, "that I would not be apologizing to you if it were not for the concert perhaps that is true. But it is also true that I have felt ever since it happened that I should not have said what I did and that I have been sorry for it all winter. That is all I can say. If you feel you can't forgive me I suppose there is nothing more to be said."</p></div> </div>
