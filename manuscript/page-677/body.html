It seems to me that I can hear Walter's voice repeating it--that little poem into which he put his soul, and which will therefore live for ever, carrying Walter's name on through the future of our land. Everything about me is calm and peaceful and 'homey.' Walter seems very near me--if I could just sweep aside the thin wavering little veil that hangs between, I could see him--just as he saw the Pied Piper the night before Courcelette.</p><p>"Over there in France tonight--does the line hold?"</p></div> </div>
