<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> We'll look beyond the years--to the time when the war will be over and Jem and Jerry and I will come marching home and we'll all be happy again."</p><p>"We won't be--happy--in the same way," said Rilla.</p><p>"No, not in the same way. Nobody whom this war has touched will ever be happy again in quite the same way. But it will be a better happiness, I think, little sister--a happiness we've earned. We were very happy before the war, weren't we? With a home like Ingleside, and a father and mother like ours we couldn't help being happy. But that happiness was a gift from life and love; it wasn't really ours--life could take it back at any time. It can never take away the happiness we win for ourselves in the way of duty. I've realised that since I went into khaki.</p></div> </div>
