<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> But sometimes," concluded Rilla bitterly--she liked to speak bitterly now and then in imitation of Miss Oliver--"sometimes I think Walter cares more for Dog Monday than he does for me."</p><p>Dog Monday was the Ingleside dog, so called because he had come into the family on a Monday when Walter had been reading Robinson Crusoe. He really belonged to Jem but was much attached to Walter also. He was lying beside Walter now with nose snuggled against his arm, thumping his tail rapturously whenever Walter gave him an absent pat. Monday was not a collie or a setter or a hound or a Newfoundland. He was just, as Jem said, "plain dog"--very plain dog, uncharitable people added. Certainly, Monday's looks were not his strong point. Black spots were scattered at random over his yellow carcass, one of them, apparently, blotting out an eye. His ears were in tatters, for Monday was never successful in affairs of honour.</p></div> </div>
