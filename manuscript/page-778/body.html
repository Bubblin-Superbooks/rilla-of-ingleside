Do you mean he is dead, Susan?"</p><p>"No, Mrs. Dr. dear, that beast is not dead. But you will never see him again. I feel sure of that."</p><p>"Don't be so mysterious, Susan. What has happened to him?"</p><p>"Well, Mrs. Dr. dear, he was sitting out on the back steps this afternoon. It was just after the news came that the Armistice had been signed and he was looking his Hydest. I can assure you he was an awesome looking beast. All at once, Mrs. Dr. dear, Bruce Meredith came around the corner of the kitchen walking on his stilts. He has been learning to walk on them lately and came over to show me how well he could do it. Mr. Hyde just took a look and one bound carried him over the yard fence. Then he went tearing through the maple grove in great leaps with his ears laid back. You never saw a creature so terrified, Mrs. Dr. dear. He has never returned."</p></div> </div>
