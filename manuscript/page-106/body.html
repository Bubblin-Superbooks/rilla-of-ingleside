And the rest went with Joe about fifteen minutes ago. See--they're just going around Birch Point. I didn't go because it's getting rough and I knew I'd be seasick. I don't mind walking home from here. It's only a mile and a half. I s'posed you'd gone. Where were you?"</p><p>"Down on the rocks with Jem and Mollie Crawford. Oh, why didn't they look for me?"</p></div> </div>
