<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>"Una, would you like to have this letter--to keep?" she asked slowly.</p><p>"Yes--if you can give it to me," Una said dully.</p><p>"Then--you may have it," said Rilla hurriedly.</p><p>"Thank you," said Una. It was all she said, but there was something in her voice which repaid Rilla for her bit of sacrifice.</p><p>Una took the letter and when Rilla had gone she pressed it against her lonely lips. Una knew that love would never come into her life now--it was buried for ever under the blood-stained soil "Somewhere in France." No one but herself--and perhaps Rilla--knew it--would ever know it. She had no right in the eyes of her world to grieve. She must hide and bear her long pain as best she could--alone. But she, too, would keep faith.</p></div> </div>
