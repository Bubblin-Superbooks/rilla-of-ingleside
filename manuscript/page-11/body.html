<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Four years previously Rilla Blythe had had a treasured darling of a kitten, white as snow, with a saucy black tip to its tail, which she called Jack Frost. Susan disliked Jack Frost, though she could not or would not give any valid reason therefor.</p><p>"Take my word for it, Mrs. Dr. dear," she was wont to say ominously, "that cat will come to no good."</p><p>"But why do you think so?" Mrs. Blythe would ask.</p><p>"I do not think--I know," was all the answer Susan would vouchsafe.</p><p>With the rest of the Ingleside folk Jack Frost was a favourite; he was so very clean and well groomed, and never allowed a spot or stain to be seen on his beautiful white suit; he had endearing ways of purring and snuggling; he was scrupulously honest.</p></div> </div>
