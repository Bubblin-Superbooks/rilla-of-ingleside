She had heard her mother say that she loved turns in roads--they were so provocative and alluring. Rilla thought she hated them. She had seen Jem and Jerry vanish from her around a bend in the road--then Walter--and now Ken. Brothers and playmate and sweetheart--they were all gone, never, it might be, to return. Yet still the Piper piped and the dance of death went on.</p><p>When Rilla walked slowly back to the house Susan was still sitting by the veranda table and Susan was sniffing suspiciously.</p><p>"I have been thinking, Rilla dear, of the old days in the House of Dreams, when Kenneth's mother and father were courting and Jem was a little baby and you were not born or thought of. It was a very romantic affair and she and your mother were such chums.</p></div> </div>
