Lloyd George is her pet hero, now that Kitchener is gone.</p><p>"'I stand behind Lloyd George every time,' retorted Susan.</p><p>"'I suppose that will hearten him up greatly,' said Warren Mead, with one of his disagreeable 'haw-haws.'</p><p>"Warren's remark was spark to powder. Susan just 'sailed in' as she puts it, and 'said her say.' She said it remarkably well, too. There was no lack of 'ginger' in her speech, anyhow. When Susan is warmed up she has no mean powers of oratory, and the way she trimmed those men down was funny and wonderful and effective all at once. She said it was the likes of her, millions of her, that did stand behind Lloyd George, and did hearten him up. That was the key-note of her speech.</p></div> </div>
